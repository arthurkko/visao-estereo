# Intro
This repo is part of my Final paper. 

The job was to develop a stereo vision system to be part of the autonomous car project in Instituto Mau√° de Tecnologia (IMT).

Here you'll find the codes, python virtual environment, and the chessboard used to calibrate the cameras.

# Hardware

The goal was to run all this in the edge, in this case, a Jetson Nano.

# Set Up

For future consults, I'll give an step-by-step on setting up the Jetson Nano, as it's always turned bad when I had to do it.

We'll run Yolov8, and it requires python3.8.

Jetpack SDK (Jetson OS from Nvidia) comes with pre-installed python2.7 and python3.6. Therefore, the plan is to create an python virtual environment to install python3.8.

## Install Jetpack
To install the Jetpack into the Jetson Nano, follow the steps in this [link](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/get-started-jetson-nano-devkit#write).

Choose your OS and then boot the Jetson.

## Increase swap
Follow the steps in this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/uvU8AXY1170?t=650)

## Enable nvcc
Write on terminal
```bash
nvcc --version
```

If it result in `bash: nvcc: command not found`, it'll be necessary to add `nvcc` to the `PATH`.

Write in terminal
```bash
vi /home/$USER/.bashrc
```

Go to the end of the final and add
```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/cuda-10.2/bin:$PATH"

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda-10.2/LIB64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
```

Close and open the terminal again. Write `nvcc --version` and the Cuda version should be displayed.

## Set up environment

Update sudo 
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Install python3.8
```bash
sudo apt install -y python3.8 python3.8-venv python3.8-dev python3-pip \
libopenmpi-dev libomp-dev libopenblas-dev libblas-dev libeigen3-dev libcublas-dev
```

Create env
```bash
python3.8 -m venv venv # Rename your virtual environment if you want
```

To activate the env
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Upgrade pip
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Dependencies
### Install opencv
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

### Install numpy
```bash
pip install numpy
```

### Install yolov8
```bash
sudo apt-get install libpython3.8-dev
```
```bash
pip install ultralytics
```
### Install pytorch

We cannot install pytorch defalut packege on PiPy because it hasn't CUDA compatibility.

Thus, follow the steps:

```bash
pip install -U pip wheel gdown
```

```bash
# pytorch 1.11.0
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1hs9HM0XJ2LPFghcn7ZMOs5qu5HexPXwM
# torchvision 0.12.0
gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1m0d8ruUY8RvCP9eVjZw4Nc8LAwM8yuGV
pip install torch-*.whl torchvision-*.whl
```
