# Intro
This repo is part of my Final paper. 

The job was to develop a stereo vision system to be part of the autonomous car project in Instituto Mau√° de Tecnologia (IMT).

Here you'll find the codes, python virtual environment, and the chessboard used to calibrate the cameras.

# Hardware

The goal was to run all this in the edge, in this case, a Jetson Nano.

## Set Up

For future consults, I'll give an step-by-step on setting up the Jetson Nano, as it's always turned bad when I had to do it.

We'll run Yolov8, and it requires python3.8.

Jetson Jetpack (Jetson Nano OS from Nvidia) comes with pre-installed python2.7 and python3.6. Therefore, the plan is to create an python virtual environment to install python3.8.

### Pre-requisits

```bash
sudo apt-get install virtualenv
```
confirm that venv is installed properly
```bash
virtualenv --version
```

create env
```bash
python3 -m venv my_env
```

install python3.8
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3.8
```

add python3.8 to env
```bash
virtualenv -p python3.8 my_env
```

to activate the env
```bash
source my_env/bin/activate
```

### Dependencies
install opencv
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

install numpy
```bash
pip install numpy
```

install yolov8
```bash
sudo apt-get install libpython3.8-dev
```
```bash
pip install ultralytics
```
