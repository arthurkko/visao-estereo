# Implement GNSS RTK integration

## What is RTK
GNSS RTK, or Global Navigation Satellite System Real-Time Kinematic, is a precise and advanced positioning technique used in surveying, geodesy, and various other applications that require high-precision location data.

## Purpose
After the implementation of object detection and distance calculation, the step 2 of the project would be estimate the car's postion on the map based only on the images of the cameras.

## Project status
Until the date of this writing it still was not implemented.
